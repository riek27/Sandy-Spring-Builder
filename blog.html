                                <p><strong>Bradley Boulevard | Bethesda, MD</strong><br>
                                Gold Award | Custom Contemporary Home</p>
                                <p>Sandy Spring Builders was tasked to build a clean line contemporary home on busy Bradley Boulevard in Bethesda. The home provides a very modern styled front façade with beautifully cut dry-stacked stone, large glass-faced stair tower, wood accents, and a beautiful wide plank metal roof. The 4-car garage is subtly blended in with contemporary garage doors. The scale of the home is perfect for the two-acre lot and large frontage on this main road.</p>
                                <p>You enter the home through a very substantial custom-made door into a dramatic two-story space with a long suspended bridge above defining the space between the Foyer and the Great Room/Dining Room. The view as you look into that room is a spectacular 20’ high wall of glass in the rear looking out at the pool in the background, all in axis with the entry. This is just a stunning beautiful open space that has incredibly custom details.</p>
                                <p>The kitchen and all cabinets and built-ins are very smooth and custom made but have a warm feeling from the wood. The lower level has a fantastic bar/entertainment area with a glass-enclosed wine cellar. Also, in the lower level there is a Peloton exercise room, a golf simulator, and a room where the owner teaches Zoom Jazzercise classes.</p>
                                <p>The result is an unbelievable contemporary structure with a first-floor Owner’s suite, secluded second-floor guest suite, open floor plan, and a perfect home for entertaining. The backyard entertaining area has a screen porch with a separate powder room, and the pool also features a spa area. The craftsmanship and attention to every detail is evident throughout this stunning contemporary home.</p>

                                <p><strong>Moorland Home | Bethesda, MD</strong><br>
                                Gold Award | Custom Traditional Home</p>
                                <p>This Bethesda home, designed by GTM Architects and built by Sandy Spring Builders, is in the sought-after Edgemoor neighborhood and was designed for comfortable living for a family of six. The house plays on a “black and white” theme and color palette, both inside and out.</p>
                                <p>The traditional hipped roof exterior massing of the house includes tall black glass windows set against white brick facades, accented by a beautiful precast front entry with a solid stained mahogany front door. A detached 2-car garage with low roof line is in the rear of the house, where it is less noticeable and also serves to create a more private rear yard. Great attention was paid to manipulating the rear yard grades with the addition of concrete retaining walls on 3 sides, allowing for a near-level yard and tall landscape screening against nearby neighbors’ houses.</p>
                                <p>Inside, the black-and-white theme continues with thoughtful, contemporary finishes and brass accents throughout. 9-foot-tall glass windows and doors throughout the entire first floor allow ample light to shine upon the simple, elegant interior trim details and strategic panel molding accents on walls and ceilings. A large rear screened porch with a retracting vinyl window system and gas fireplace allows for this indoor/outdoor space to be used year-round.</p>
                                <p>Custom high-gloss black finished walls and cabinetry in the Butler’s Pantry with antiqued mirror contrast with the clean, white and brass kitchen that is directly adjacent. Other highlights include a golf simulator and polished concrete floors in the basement, and a bunk room on the second floor for young guests.</p>
